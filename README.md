# Static_Hand_Gesture_Recognition_Using_CNN

This project is the research project for the Master of Data Science programme.

## Background
In recent years, the number of studies on hand gesture recognition has grown and the hand gesture recognition research eventually becomes an active field of research for researchers. Hand gesture recognition systems can be categorized into device-based and vision-based. Due to having better practicality in real-life situations, this study will focus on the vision-based hand gesture recognition. There are two types of hand gestures: static or dynamic. Dynamic hand gesture recognition appeared to be more complex and challenging. For this reason, this study will be carried out on static gestures only. This study will propose a static hand gesture recognition system using deep learning architectures. According to Mohamed et al. (2021), convolution neural network (CNN) is one of the most widely used techniques because it can detect important features automatically without the need of human supervisions. Hand gesture recognition has many applications in our life, and one of them is in sign language translation. This study will use a public sign language dataset from Massey University, called MU HandImages ASL dataset, which has a total of 2515 images with 36 classes.

## Problem Statement
The difficulty in communication is one of the major barriers faced by deaf community and can affect their life in an undesired way. Even though they use hand gestures along with facial expressions and body movements to communicate, but not many people learn the sign language and can understand them. This barrier is a major social concern and can be solved using the advanced technology in deep learning such as neural networks. However, this learning is heavily reliant on large amount of the training data to avoid overfitting. One of the ways to deal with this problem is using data augmentation. 

## Research Objectives
1. To propose a static hand gesture recognition system using convolutional neural network (CNN).
2. To demonstrate the optimal static hand gesture recognition using various data augmentation techniques. 
3. To evaluate the performance of the proposed static hand gesture recognition system.
